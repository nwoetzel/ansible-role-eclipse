This Ansible Eclipse role is based on the work from [Alban Andrieu](fr.linkedin.com/in/nabla/) which one may find [here](https://github.com/AlbanAndrieu/ansible-eclipse). It has been extensively rewritten to support anysier installation and configuration of plugins, different eclipse distributions and packages (downloads).

## Description

This ansible roles installs a eclipse distribution and optional plugins.

## Dependencies

- ansible >= 2.4
- geerlingguy.java
- GROG.package

## Role Variables

All defaults should also be documented in the [defaults](defaults/main.yml) file.

| variable | required | default | description |
|--:|:-:|:-:|:--|
| eclipse_distro | yes | - | the eclipse distribution, e.g. mars, neon |
| eclipse_package | yes | - | the package (i.e. which default plugins are installed), e.g. java, php, cpp ... |
| eclipse_os | no | - | the operating system to install for (linux, win, macosx) - is derived using ansible_system |
| eclipse_arch | no | - | the system architecture (x86, x86_64) - is derived using ansible_architecture |
| eclipse_tar_file | no | - | the actual tar file downloaded - is assembled from above information, but sometimes needs overwriting, due to inconsistent rule for generating full download urls |
| eclipse_mirror_id | no | - | an optional mirror_id for downloading the package, if the default behavior of picking the best one, does not work |
| eclipse_plugins_custom | no | {} | a dictionary of plugin declarations (to add more to the defaults in vars/main.yml or to overwrite) - read more in defaults/main.yml |
| eclipse_plugins_install | no | [] | list of plugin names to be installed, as they are defined in the [vars](vars/main.yml) or with the variable eclipse_plugins_custom |
| package_list_eclipse | no | [] | additional apt package names that should be installed |
| eclipse_download_folder_remote | no | - | when set, the file is downloaded to the installation host |
| eclipse_service_release | no | set by this [role](vars/main.yml) | the latest known is used when not set - depending on the distro can be 'SR2' (<=luna) or just '2' (>=mars) |
| eclipse_ini_overwrite | no | false | modify eclipse.ini |
| eclipse_ini_flags_next_line | no | {} | a dictionary of ini flags for eclipse, e.g. '"-vm": /opt/bin/java' |
| eclipse_ini_flags_vmargs | no | {} | a dictionary of vmargs for the java virtual machine, e.g. '"-XX:MaxPermSize=": "1024m"' |
| eclipse_ui_id_prefs_settings | no | { SHOW_WORKSPACE_SELECTION_DIALOG: "false",  RECENT_WORKSPACES: ""} | key-value pairs to insert/overwrite in the org.eclipse.ui.ide.prefs file |

## Facts

| variable | description |
|--:|:--|
| eclipse_install_dir | the directory eclipse is installed to |

## Possibilities

It is possible to install almost any [eclipse package of any distribution](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/). Currently, incubation packages and classic distributions are not supported.
Additinally, many plugins are preconfigured and can just be installed through their name.

## Limitations

Eclipse packages with incubation components or classic distributions are not supported yet. (with eclipse_tar_file, one can fix it a little)
Plugins need to be configured in the role, before they can be installed trough their name or repository url.
Adaption for either limitation can be easily implemented.

## Dependencies

This role depends on [geerlingguy.java](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-java) to install a jdk and to set the '-vm' argument in the eclipse.ini. This dependency can be removed from meta/main.yml - and the role will work but will require a java to be in the PATH or JAVA_HOME to be set.
This role also depends on [GROG.package](https://github.com/GROG/ansible-role-package) to install some minor dependencies.
